Solidity Smart Contracts

A collection of Solidity smart contracts and blockchain development exercises 🚀

This repository includes:

Solidity fundamentals: Implementations demonstrating basic syntax, variable handling, and a simple calculator contract.

Deployment setup: Configurations and scripts used to deploy the contracts to a blockchain environment.

Core Solidity features: Examples showcasing mappings, arrays, structs, require statements, modifiers, and event handling.

Twitter-style contract: A fully developed mini-Twitter smart contract with tweet structs, character-limit rules, like functionality, and other extended features.

DApp integration: Code used to connect the Twitter contract with a front-end DApp for interaction.

Advanced concepts: Implementations covering loops, contract inheritance, and contract-to-contract communication.

Final project: A feature-enhanced Twitter contract with user profiles and account-creation flows, along with corresponding DApp updates.
